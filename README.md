# map673-Final-Project
The goal of this map is to showcase a variety of methods and tools that have been acquired in MAP 673. Techniques using CSS, html, Javascript, and others are incorporated into this interactive map.

Map objectives
Provide the user with a comprehensive picture of the transportation options in the Chicago metropolitan area in relation to locations of key nodes of daily living (e.g. grocery stores, schools, hospitals) as well as demographic variables as represented in Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZ). My goal is to show how transportation is a central element in daily life and how—for some in underserved communities—transportation options are limited for persons or households who do not own a vehicle.
